    "As we have the line-up for every game of Season 1, it would be interesting to compute a performance score for each player based on their contributions throughout the season.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we first compile the starting XI of each team for every game and then aggregate the data over the season using a unique player ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows us to generate statistics for each player for Season 1 using the available game data, providing insights into their impact. The goal is to summarize each playerâ€™s performance and measure their influence on the season's outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that this metric represents an average impact and cannot precisely capture their contribution without specific player-related data. However, by aggregating data over Season 1, we aim to evaluate the overall defensive and attacking influence of each player.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, this analysis would cover all players, regardless of their position on the field. However, due to time constraints, we will focus exclusively on goalkeepers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goalkeepers likely have the most measurable impact on a game. Unlike outfield players, whose performance often depends on their partnerships (e.g., Saliba and Gabriel perform well together), we can evaluate a goalkeeper's performance more directly. This can be done using metrics such as the number of goals and shots they conceded.\n",
    "\n",
    "An appropriate rating for goalkeepers could be calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Rating} = \\text{\\text{Number of conceded goals}{\\text{Number of conceded shots}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "While we may not know whether every shot was on target, we will assume that the percentage of shots on target is consistent across teams. Moreover, as teams all play each other, it should not significantly affect our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will assume that goalkeepers perform similarly in home and away games. While this may not be entirely accurate, we can reasonably assume that their shot-blocking percentage remains consistent regardless of where they play. Although goalkeepers may face more shots when playing away (as teams often perform worse), using the ratio of goals conceded to shots conceded ensures that this factor does not influence the results."
