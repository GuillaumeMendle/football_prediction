    "As we now have a better understanding of the data, we will proceed to create a model to predict the games of season 2. We will train a Poisson regression model using only season 1 data. Two models will be created: one for home predictions and one for away predictions. This way, each model can capture any potential advantage of playing at home, which is typically expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first generate features based on the attacking and defensive performances of every team throughout the season. Additionally, we will include the rating of the goalkeepers for each game in the model's input, that way the model will also incorporate a feature related to the starting XI.\n",
